# GESTURE-VOLUME-CONTROL-USING-PYTHON

# Description
This project is a real-time volume control application that uses hand gestures to adjust the system volume. It leverages computer vision techniques and machine learning models to track hand movements and adjust the volume accordingly. The application uses OpenCV and MediaPipe for hand tracking, and the pycaw library to control system volume.

# Features
Real-Time Hand Tracking: Uses MediaPipe to detect and track hand landmarks.
Volume Control: Adjusts the system volume based on the distance between the thumb and index finger.
Interactive Visualization: Displays live video feed with hand landmarks and connections drawn.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV: pip install opencv-python
MediaPipe: pip install mediapipe
Numpy: pip install numpy
Pycaw: pip install pycaw
